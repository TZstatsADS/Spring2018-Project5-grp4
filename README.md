+ Project summary:
+ Click fraud occurs on the Internet in pay-per-click (PPC) online advertising. It occurs when a person, automated script or computer program imitates a legitimate user to click on ad. For companies that advertise online, click fraud can happen at an overwhelming volume, resulting in misleading click data and wasted money. According to TalkingData, 90% of clicks are potentially fraudulent.
+ In this project, we implemented models to predict whether a user will download an app after clicking a mobile app ad. By doing this, we hope to flag IP addresses who produce lots of clicks, but never end up installing apps. Our final goal is to help app developers detecting and avoiding click fraud to save cost and obtain an accurate market feedback.
